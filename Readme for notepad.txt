Information:

This program will format floppy disks! It's not like a the old programs that format disks. This
one formats the entire disk more then once on a full format. It formats it more then once
so that it erases all data like you bought a brand new disk. It also gives it a new serial number.

The floppy must be in before you run the program for it to register a serial number!

Windows XP users must install for each individual user on the computer!

It is known to work on all floppy drives!

Troubleshooting:

It is not reading my floppy!

Check to see if the disk is right protected. If it not on right protect,
then the disk may be damaged.

When I install the program, I get an error saying that something could not be installed!

Just click the ignore button. Sometimes a certain file is in use that needs to be installed. 
The setup will still continue and you will be able to install the program!

It keeps saying that I don't have enough free memory to run the program!

You need to close down some of your programs so that there is enough room to run the program!
